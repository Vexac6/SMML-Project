# SMML-Project

Little project made by me for the course of Statistical Methods for Machine Learning.
The work consists in a bunch of slightly different neural network architectures trained on
the same dataset, the Fruits-360 by Mihai Oltean from Kaggle.com.

----- USAGE -----
The work was conducted with the two pieces of code inside the Sandbox folder. They were
edited and re-trained every time to study the effect of the parameters change on the average
prediction accuracy. The results are reported in the paper and stored in the Results folder.
The main program is called accuracy_evaluation_app, and it's a CLI which asks the user to tinker with
the neural networks available. The user can print, edit, select predefined model and then train
the chosen model. The results are not automatically saved, but pyplot has the save button for that
reason.

***** CREDITS *****
All the work was made by me, including the changes to the original Fruits-360 dataset. All the
credits for the dataset go to Mihai Oltean, who posted it at https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits.
Thanks to professor Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi from Università degli Studi di Milano for teaching the
SMML class and assigning various projects.
